				<h3>Who I am</h3>
				<div class="section-content">
					<p>I've been programming for around 5 years now, mainly doing iOS work. I love tinkering with stuff and building beautiful and useful products. In my free time, you can either find me building things in my dorm, getting boba with friends, or watching King of the Hill reruns.</p>
				</div>

				<h3>What I've worked on</h3>
				<div class="section-content">
					<p class=""><strong><a href="bit.ly/gradesapp" target="blank">Grades</a></strong> - An iOS app that allows students to check their grades and make "what if" calculations. Hooks into Aeries' private APIs. Over 455,000 downloads with over 150,000 daily active users.</p>
					<p class="about"><strong>SMS Grades</strong> - An SMS texting service that allows students without smartphones to text a # and instantly get their grades back. Built with Twilio.</p>
					<p class="about"><strong><a href="http://teenhacks.org/" target="blank">TeenHacks</a></strong> - In 2014, I founded TeenHacks, a high school hackathon in SoCal. I raised 10k from corporate sponsors such as Wolfram Alpha, Make School, and Microsoft and attracted over 200 students for a full 24 hours of hacking and learning.</p>

				<h3>What I'm interested in</h3>
				<div class="section-content">
					<p>I'm currently looking for software engineering internship opportunities for summer 2017. I'm especially interested in trying out a backend infrastructure role. If you're hiring and are interested in my profile, let's chat.<br><br>In the long term, I'd like to get involved in a startup. "I can always find another job but look at us, doing this, it's intoxicating, don't act like it's not magical!" &mdash; Jared from Silicon Valley</p>
