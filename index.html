				<h3>Who I am</h3>
				<div class="section-content">
					<p>I've been programming for around 5 years now, mainly doing iOS work. I love tinkering with stuff and building beautiful and useful products. In my free time, you can either find me hacking away at hackathons or just building cool stuff in my dorm.</p>
				</div>

				<h3>What I've worked on</h3>
				<div class="section-content">
					<p class=""><strong><a href="bit.ly/gradesapp" target="blank">Grades</a></strong> - An iOS app that allows students to check their grades and make "what if" calculations. Hooks into Aeries' private APIs. Over 250,000 downloads with over 120,000 daily active users.</p>
					<p class="about"><strong>SMS Grades</strong> - An SMS texting service that allows students without smartphones to text a # and instantly get their grades back. Built with Twilio.</p>
					<p class="about"><strong><a href="http://teenhacks.org/" target="blank">TeenHacks</a></strong> - In 2014, I founded TeenHacks, a high school hackathon in SoCal. I raised 10k from corporate sponsors such as Wolfram Alpha, Make School, and Microsoft and attracted over 200 students for a full 24 hours of hacking and learning.</p>

				<h3>What I'm interested in</h3>
				<div class="section-content">
					<p>I'm currently looking for software engineering internship opportunities for summer 2016. If you're hiring and are interested in my profile, let's chat. In the long term, I'd like to get involved in a startup.
